## My process

I began making layout in HTML, then styling with CSS for mobile and desktop versions requested.
After been succesful with pixel perfect appereance I went for the bonus writing a script for loading data from json file. After some thinking I migrated the whole thing to React.JS, since with components this would be really easy. Finally, I tested everything and I sent it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React JS
- Typescript
- New CSS color-mix command for transparencies

### What I learned

I learned more good practices for dual CSS styling with @media queries for mobile first and then for desktop. This was a good practice for a React JS simple project.

### Useful resources

- [PicPick](https://picpick.app/en/) - Very useful tools for web development tasks, like measuring of pixels on image and a very nice color picker.
